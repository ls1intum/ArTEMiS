Overview
--------

Conducting a programming exercise consists of 7 steps distributed among
instructor, Artemis and students:

1. **Instructor prepares exercise:** Set up a repository containing the
   exercise code and test cases, build instructions on the CI server,
   and configures the exercise in Artemis.
2. **Student starts exercise:** Click on start exercise on Artemis which
   automatically generates a copy of the repository with the exercise
   code and configures a build plan accordingly.
3. **Optional: Student clones repository:** Clone the personalized
   repository from the remote VCS to the local machine.
4. **Student solves exercise:** Solve the exercise with an IDE of choice
   on the local computer or in the online editor.
5. **Student uploads solution:** Upload changes of the source code to
   the VCS by committing and pushing them to the remote server (or by
   clicking submit in the online editor).
6. **CI server verifies solution:** verify the studentâ€™s submission by
   executing the test cases (see step 1) and provide feedback which
   parts are correct or wrong.
7. **Student reviews personal result:** Reviews build result and
   feedback using Artemis. In case of a failed build, reattempt to solve
   the exercise (step 4).
8. **Instructor reviews course results:** Review overall results of all
   students, and react to common errors and problems.

Setup
--------

The following sections describe the supported features and the process of creating a new programming exercise.

Online Editor
-------------

The following screenshot shows the online code editor with interactive
and dynamic exercise instructions on the right side. Tasks and UML
diagram elements are referenced by test cases and update their color
from red to green after students submit a new version and all test cases
associated with a task or diagram element pass. This allows the students
to immediately recognize which tasks are already fulfilled and is
particularly helpful for programming beginners.

Testing with Artemis Java Test Sandbox
--------------------------------------

Artemis Java Test Sandbox *(abbr. AJTS)* is a JUnit 5 extension for easy and secure Java testing
on Artemis.

Its main features are

* a security manager to prevent students crashing the tests or cheating
* more robust tests and builds due to limits on time, threads and io
* support for public and hidden Artemis tests, where hidden ones obey a custom deadline
* utilities for improved feedback in Artemis like processing multiline error messages
  or pointing to a possible location that caused an Exception
* utilities to test exercises using System.out and System.in comfortably
