## Test Repository instructions

#### Test tool & command
Tests will be run using stack: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

#### Note
This template has only experimental support so far.

It will be extended in the upcoming weeks (as of 24.06.2020).

This template does not work out of the box with CI at the moment.
 Among other things, it requires the build process to checkout the solution folder, which is not yet done automatically.
