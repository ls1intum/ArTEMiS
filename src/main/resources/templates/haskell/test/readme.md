## Test Repository instructions

#### Test tool & command
Tests will be run using stack: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

#### Note
This template has only experimental support so far.
It will be extended in the upcoming weeks (as of 24.06.2020).

This template does not work out of the box with CI at the moment.
Among other things, it requires the build process to checkout the solution folder, which is not yet done automatically.

<!-- #### Sequential test runs -->
<!-- If you have decided to use the sequential test runs feature for this exercise, read the following instructions: -->
<!-- We use the folder structure of the test repository to differentiate structural and behavior tests: -->
<!-- 1. Structural test files must be placed in the folder "structural" -->
<!-- 2. Behavior test files must be placed in the folder "behavior" -->

<!-- Files in other folders will not be executed! -->
