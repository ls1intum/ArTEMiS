 * This is the main interface between an IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) and this webapp. If a student has the Orion plugin
 * installed (https://github.com/ls1intum/Orion), this service will be used for communication between the
 * IDE Artemis itself.
 *
 * The communication itself is bidirectional, meaning that the IDE can call Typescript code
 * using the by the JavaUpcallBridge interface defined methods. On the other side, the Angular app can execute
 * Kotlin/Java coode inside the IDE by calling the JavaDowncallBridge interface.
 *
 * In order to be always available, it is essential that this service gets instantiated right after loading the app
 * in the browser. This service has to always be available in the native window object, so that if an IDE is connected,
 * it can find the object during the integrated IDE browser instantiation.
