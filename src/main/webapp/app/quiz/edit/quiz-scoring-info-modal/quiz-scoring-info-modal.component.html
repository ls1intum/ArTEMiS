                <td>Each correct answer results in a fraction of the total score. To avoid guesswork, the same fraction is subtracted from the achieved points for each mistake.
                    Example: if the score of the question is 3 and there are 5 options. Each correct answer option results in 0.6 points. Each wrong answer option subtracts 0.6 points.
                    A student with 4 correct and 1 wrong choice would then receive 1.8 points.</td>
