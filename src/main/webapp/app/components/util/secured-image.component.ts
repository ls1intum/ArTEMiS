/**
 * Solution taken from: https://stackblitz.com/edit/secure-image-loads?file=app%2Fsecured-image.component.ts
 * Some browsers (i.e. Chrome) perform some toString function on the src attribute, which causes null to become 'null'
 * instead of '', thus triggering to the browser to look for //domain.com/null which results in an error
 * That's why I had to replace the attribute [src] with [attr.src]
 * This works because instead of setting src to either 'null' or '', the src attribute isn't set at all as long as the
 * variable/path used is not set/resolved, therefore not triggering the error.
