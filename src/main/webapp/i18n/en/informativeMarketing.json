You can create as many exams as you like for your course and register all or some of your students. Within the exam you can insert as many exercises as you like from all known exercise types of the Artemis platform including: programming-, modeling-, text-, file upload and quiz exercises such as multiple choice questions. Complete as many test runs as you like to make sure everything will run smoothly for the students. Students are limited to a definable amount of time to complete their exam and submit. They can nagivate between the exercise and solve them in any order they like. \nNo stable internet connection? Not an issue. All changes made by the students are saved locally and automatically synced every 60 seconds. \nOnce the exam conduction is over, it is time for your tutors to assess their submissions. The integrated assessment is done through the tutor exam drashboard which aggregates the progress of all tutors to provide a clear overview. Say goodbye to manual assessment tracking and excel spreadsheets.\nWith all exams assessed you can release the results and allow all students to view their result. If they believe they found a mistake in their assessment they can use the complaint feature to request a re-review. A tutor, other than the original one, will then be able to re-assess the specific submission and decide whether to accept or reject the complaint.\nFinally Artemis also creates a statistical report of the exam to evaluate and examine the performance of your students. \nCreate, conduct & assess, all within Artemis!",

These are then executed automatically for every student submission when the exam ends and are graded accordingly. You can also decide to tweak the weight of every test and provide bonus points. Additionally, you can use static analysis tools to further support your grading efforts. All rules can be weighted differently, and you can define limits to how many points should be deducted if a mistake is repeated often. Finally, your tutors can review the automatic programming exercise assessment and override or confirm the evaluation. Text and modeling exercises are supported via a trainable semi-automatic system which can detect reoccurring patterns and provide hints towards how a specific section should be graded. \nUsing these tools, your next exam will be graded in no time!\n",
